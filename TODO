* update CSV reading to not be so janky (what if format changes and deleting the last two lines deletes real data :/ )
* set up proper db migration framework
* use proper data types in database
* preperly get DB credentials from env
* create library (or find library) to load settings cleanly
* set log level @ env var level also
* set up local db for testing
* calculate and store `Monthly Spend` for all IAAS
* extract each IAAS as a resource or something so that new resources can be added to calculate billing info from (eg Pagerduty)
* allow storage bucket to be different if desired (or remove storage bucket entirely)
* backfill tests where necessary
* add configurable frontend?
* make normalizer generic?
